# Bradykinin-Type-2-Receptor-Deficiency-Analysis-of-Microglial-Neuron-and-Neutrophil-Morphology

ImageJ macros were written by Dinko SmiloviÄ‡, with acknowledgments and thanks to Elisa M York and her 2018 MATLAB-based script 3DMorph https://github.com/ElisaYork/3DMorph.

For the purposes of methodology concerning the automated analysis of microglia shape (preprocessing of images so that they can be analyzed by Elisa M Yorks 3DMorph script), neuron cell number, and neutrophil total volume, the following ImageJ scripts have been uploaded:
